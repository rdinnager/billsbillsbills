## Why `billsbillsbills`?

Because this package is filled with so many bird bills obviously, one bills was not enough. Also the 3 bills represents the 3 dimensions that the dataset exists in. The package name can also be written as bills<sup>3</sup>, and the data coordinates are *X* ∈ ℝ<sup>3</sup>, so it just made sense. There is no connection or affiliation with the hit song from 90's Destiny's Child, though I cannot stop you from humming it under your breath while using this package (nor can I be legally liable for such a happening).
